## Code Quiz
(WIP)
I built this code quiz to test my knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals.

Features
I can take a timed quiz on pokemon.
I can see my score at the end of the quiz.
I can save my initials and score to a high scores list.

## Running the Quiz
I download or clone the repository.
I open the index.html file in a web browser.
I click the start button to begin the quiz.
I answer the questions before the timer runs out.
I enter my initials and save my score when the game is over.
I hope you enjoy taking the quiz!
